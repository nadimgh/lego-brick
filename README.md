# Lego-Brick Approach to Coding for Network Communication
This repository provides MATLAB implementation of the Lego-brick design of codes for network communication. More details about the coding schemes are available here: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07208](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07208)

## Overview of what is provided
Implementations of coding schemes are provided for the problems of:
- Lossy source coding
- Gelfand-Pinsker coding
- Marton coding for broadcast channels
- Coding for cloud radio access networks (downlink and uplink)

Polar codes with successive cancellation decoding are used as the constituent point-to-point channel codes. The rates of the polar codes are chosen "close" to their theoretical limits, as described in the paper. The *src* directory includes scripts that are re-used for multiple problems, including the implementations of all encoders and decoders. Scripts that are specific to a coding problem are given in the corresponding directory. 

## Support
Any questions and/or suggestions from members of the information, coding and communication theory communities are warmly welcomed. Email: [nghaddar@ucsd.edu](mailto:nghaddar@ucsd.edu)
